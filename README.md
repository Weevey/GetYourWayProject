All work to be done on branches made off dev branch

One of the most popular branch naming conventions in Git is called the "Gitflow" convention. In this convention, branches are named according to their purpose or function, such as:

main: The main branch that contains the most up-to-date, stable version of the code.
develop: The branch that contains the latest version of the code, including features under development and bug fixes.
feature/<feature-name>: A branch created from develop to develop a new feature. The name of the branch should reflect the name of the feature being developed.
hotfix/<problem-description>: A branch created from master to fix a critical issue in the code. The name of the branch should describe the issue being fixed.
release/<version-number>: A branch created from develop to prepare for a new release. The name of the branch should reflect the version number of the release.


Commit message format - 
  fix: Used to indicate a bug fix.
  chore: Used to indicate changes that do not affect the code, such as updates to build scripts, configuration files, etc.
  docs: Used to indicate changes to documentation files.
  style: Used to indicate changes that do not affect the code logic, such as code formatting or white space changes.
  refactor: Used to indicate code refactoring, which is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its behaviour.
  test: Used to indicate changes to test cases or test frameworks.
  perf: Used to indicate improvements to the code's performance.
  feat: Used to indicate adding a feature
  revert: Used to indicate that a previous commit is being undone or rolled back.
  security: Used to indicate changes related to security.merge: Used to indicate a merge of multiple branches or forks.
  update: Used to indicate updates to dependencies or external libraries.
  critical: Used to indicate critical or urgent changes that need to be applied to the codebase immediately.
  experimental: Used to indicate changes that are experimental and may not be stable.
